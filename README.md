# 🎓 Pup University Website Clone (Educational Project)

This project is a **React.js based clone** of the official Punjabi University Computer Science website.  
It was developed by me during my **45-day internship** at **RND Experts** under the guidance of **Suneel Sir**.  

⚡ It is not the exact copy — I have **redesigned it as per my needs** while keeping it close to the original design.

You can use the following credentials to test the application:
